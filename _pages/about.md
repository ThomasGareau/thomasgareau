Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student in the [Department of Government](https://government.cornell.edu/) at **Cornell University**.

Prior to Cornell, I pursued a [Master's degree in Political Science](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/grad/admissions/ma) at **McGill University,** as the inaugural Eren Graduate Fellow. My research was supported by the *Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et culture* (FRQSC), the *Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada* (SSHRC) and the *[Center for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/alumni/)*. I also hold a [Bachelor's degree in Political Science (Honours) and Data Science](https://pol.umontreal.ca/programmes-cours/premier-cycle/baccalaureat-science-politique/) from the **Université de Montréal (UdeM)**.

Feel free to contact me at **tg454[at]cornell.edu**.


## Research Interests

My research is motivated by a strong interest in the formation and evolution of political attitudes and party politics across Quebec, Canada, the United States, and other post-industrial democracies. Specifically, my research interests extend to inquiries surrounding the politics of inequality, "welfare chauvinism," political attitudes toward the welfare state, and the political economy of housing. My methodological toolkit includes survey experiments, causal inference, and the analysis of large-scale survey data.
