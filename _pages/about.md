Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student in the [Department of Government](https://government.cornell.edu/) at **Cornell University**.

Prior to Cornell, I pursued a [Master's degree in Political Science](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/grad/admissions/ma) at **McGill University,** as the inaugural Eren Graduate Fellow. My research was supported by the *Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et culture* (FRQSC), the *Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada* (SSHRC) and the *[Center for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/alumni/)*. I also hold a [Bachelor's degree in Political Science (Honours) and Data Science](https://pol.umontreal.ca/programmes-cours/premier-cycle/baccalaureat-science-politique/) from the **Université de Montréal (UdeM)**.

Feel free to contact me at **tg454[at]cornell.edu**.


## Research Interests

I am driven by a deep interest in the mechanisms shaping the formation and evolution of political attitudes and the transformations of welfare states in Quebec, Canada, the United States and other post-industrial democracies. My research agenda examines how ongoing changes in economic structures and labour markets are reshaping political cleavages and welfare regimes. I also engage with questions related to territorial identities, changes in party systems, the origins of the "diploma divide," and the political economy of housing.
